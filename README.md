#### Project Description
Businesses often find it difficult to market themselves to drive foot traffic. According to the US Bureau of labour statistics ,traditional businesses find it hard to market themselves to consumers

• About 20% of small businesses fail by the end of their first year

• By the end of their fifth year, 50% go under ;

•  And by the tenth year, that number rises to 80%

Traditional marketing methods have limitations such as high cost and being time-consuming. These problems can be solved

 • The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated businesses worldwide. These businesses include restaurants, theme parks as well as shopping malls. Prolonged lockdown and safe-distancing measures drastically decreased the foot traffic and revenue of these businesses, forcingt hem to shut down or pivot.
