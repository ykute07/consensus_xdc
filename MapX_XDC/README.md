a)About 20% of small businesses fail by the end of their First Year.

b)By the end of their fifth year, 50% go under;

c)And by the tenth year, that number rises to 80%

2)Traditional marketing methods have limitations such as high cost and being time-consuming. These problems can be solved

a)The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated businesses worldwide. These businesses include restaurants, theme parks as well as shopping malls. Prolonged lockdown and safe-distancing measures drastically decreased the foot traffic and revenue of these businesses, forcing them to shut down or pivot.

## Why Celo

Celo is one of the most viable blockchain available in the market. First-generation blockchains such as Bitcoin paved the way for the industry. However, they did not create a functional environment for developing complex smart contract-based financial solutions. Second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum introduced smart contract capabilities. However, they suffer from significant scalability issues, resulting in network congestion and high transaction fees for users.

On the other hand, Tezos is a third-generation blockchain that combines the former’s properties and has evolved to solve this issue.
